      This webpage has been put together as a portfolio of my work that is
      stored on github.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Overall, my goal for this sight is for it to expand as I take on and
      complete personal
      <br />
      projects. It will be used as a code portfolio and a means to keep track of
      projects as
      <br />
      I work on them.

	  </header>
	  <p>As most good supreme bots range from 50$ - 90$ I have begun developing an open-source version of my own.  I have chosen to use python as the language of choice as there are my libraries that will be helpful in speeding up the process of development.</p>

	  </header>
	  <p>This project has not yet been started however my intention is to develop a program that will keep track of the supreme webpage and message the user on items that they wish to purchase.  Often supreme items sell out very quickly and it can be a nuisance to keep track of restocks on internet sites thus I feel it would be very helpful to the community to have an app that takes care of this as Restocks has recently deactivated their own version of the app.

            This is the ios app that I developed for use with my senior
            projectâ€™s Indoor Automated Farm. The app allows users the ability to
            view the status of peripherals such as lights, water pumps, water
            purifier, etc. It also allowed users to set automation settings for
            lights and had a manual mode that gave users full control over each
            of the individual farm peripherals.

            This project is a culmination of every assignment that we were given
            for our cmpe146 course at San Jose State University. This course
            focused on developing a driver set specifically for the SJSU one
            board designed by our teacher Preetpal Kang. And was concluded with
            an
            <a href="https://jcook3701.github.io/CMPE146/">MP3 project</a> where
            we designed both the hardware and software for a working audio
            player.
